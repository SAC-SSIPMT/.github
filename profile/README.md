# Student Activity Centre, SSIPMT Raipur
We, Student Activity Centre, aims to provide a place for all the cool extracurricular action on campus. It's run by students, for students, and is all about helping you explore your interests and pick up new skills while having a blast.

 

We've got clubs for all kinds of passions â€“ coding people can join the Software Development Club, robotic geeks have the Robotics Club, shutterbugs will love the Photography Class, artistic souls will feel right at home in the Design Club, and wordsmiths can find their tribe at the Research and Writers Club.

 

But it's not just about clubs. We're a community that comes together for workshops, events, and sessions led by industry pros. Whether you want to level up your coding game, get hands-on with robotics, learn some photography tricks, get creative with design, or hone your writing and research skills, we've got you covered.
